    <p>The Design Tokens used within `vf-core` are generated from several `.yml` files. These are then compiled into various Sass files as needed.</p>
    <p>In the future we hope to offer Sketch and Photoshop colour palettes.</p>
    <p>If you required a different format (LESS, iOS, Android). Please get in touch.</p>

    Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

I won't dwell on it, but Helvetica and Helvetica Neue are not ideal fonts for the web for technical, brand and usability purposes, particularly when you're showing a lot of scientific data tables, <a href="https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Icon-fonts/issues/8">as we do at EMBL-EBI</a>.

Small note: Within [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) we've used Helvetica Neue as our "corporate" font both in print and online for many years, now we're considering a change. The below blog post is shaped by that discussion, but the thoughts here are my own.

After a lengthy [discussion](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Icon-fonts/issues/8) and [consultation](https://blogs.embl.org/communications/2017/07/17/selecting-a-new-typeface-for-embl-fira/) we're currently analysing Fira Sans as our likely next font for both corporate and data uses. For those that don't recall, Fira is an Erik Spiekermann typeface that [was developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fira_Sans) for Mozilla's now defunct Firefox OS.

We're working through the best way to utilise Fira Sans (and the great [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)). A major concern are fonts when it [comes to data tables](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Icon-fonts/issues/8#issuecomment-343096004).

## On with it, already

But what I want to chat about is what IBM has been up to: unveiling their new Plex font family [made by Bold Monday](https://www.boldmonday.com/custom/ibm/).

The typeface is impressive stuff that captures my interest:

1. IBM is looking to solve many of the same issues that we are at EMBL: Helvetica is an imperfect and bland go-to choice.
2. Plex has a nice bit of personality in its letter forms
3. Plex is a full family with many weights (8) and a serif, sans and mono style (it's also due to land on Google Fonts)
4. Plex has an open licence
5. Plex has a wide international character support
6. It has an active development community

With the exception of the serif style (and perhaps the development community), Fira has many of the same advantages. I also noticed that Fira and Plex share quite a bit in style, so I wanted to take a quick look at some of the letterforms.

Here's a quick comparison between, Plex, Helvetica, Fira and a couple of other stand-ins ‚Äî these are SVGs, if you want to download and compare glyphs without having to install fonts.

{% endmarkdown %}

<section class="vf-stack vf-stack--800">

  {% render '@vf-figure--default', {
    "text": 'Like Fira, Plex seems to play well where Helvetica was once used and both Fira and Plex fix a number of long-standing issues around the lowercase "L" and overly tight "c" and "e".',
    "alttext": "Plex example",
    "imageUrl": "../images/original/blog/plex.svg"
  } %}


  {% render '@vf-figure--default', {
    "text": 'Fira and Plex have personality in the letterforms. Plex might be a bit more conservative than Fira, and the uppercase "i" is a clear win for environments where you don\'t want to confuse a vertical pipe "|" and lowercase "l". The uppercase "E" has also been shortened less than Fira.',
    "alttext": "Plex letters",
    "imageUrl": "../images/original/blog/plex-letters.svg"
  } %}

  {% render '@vf-figure--default', {
    "text": 'The wide width of Plex\'s numbers is notable. Again, this may be a concession for data environments, particularly the styling of the number "1".',
    "alttext": "Plex numbers",
    "imageUrl": "../images/original/blog/plex-numbers.svg"
  } %}

  {% render '@vf-figure--default', {
    "text": 'The Plex italics add <a href="https://twitter.com/ThunderNixon/status/929043150383075329">a big flair</a> Especially in the mono style (where both Fira Code and Mono lack a true italic). However my main interest at the moment is data compatibility ‚Äî but personality in italics could be quite nice.',
    "alttext": "Fira italics",
    "imageUrl": "../images/original/blog/fira-italic.svg"
  } %}

  {% render '@vf-figure--default', {
    "text": 'Plex\'s very square "t", it feels like a mono style.',
    "alttext": "Plex notches",
    "imageUrl": "../images/original/blog/plex-notching.svg"
  } %}

</section>
{% markdown %}

On the style side, there are two major differences:
- Plex has distinct narrowing on some of the lowercase letters that are reminiscent of "[ink traps](https://nicksherman.com/articles/bellCentennial.html)"
- Fira has a slightly whimsy feel with the top and lower cap on some letters (look at the ascenders of the b, h and h, and the q's descender).

## That's all for now

On the whole, Plex seems a bit more conservative, practical and airier than Fira.

I'm sure we'll hear much more about Plex in the coming months (I'll also be very interested in  the nice [tooling](https://github.com/ibm/type-checker) around their design system), but I did want to compare and contrast Plex and Fira specifically -- or, at least a little bit of them.

If you want to have a play with Fira or Plex on your desktop, here are links (they're open licensed):

- <span class="emoji">üî°</span>  [Plex desktop fonts](https://github.com/IBM/type/archive/master.zip)

If you're also interested in using Plex in a data-heavy environment, I'd be curious to know how you get on with it: <a href="https://twitter.com/khawkins98"><span class="emoji">üê¶</span> @khawkins98</a>

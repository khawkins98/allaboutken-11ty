{% markdown %}
Since 2015 I've been working with [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/) to make a better front end platform for life-science websites. 

My work is used by more than 500 developers at EMBL across a range of systems from Angular to React, to static sites and CMSs like WordPress and Drupal. My most-frequent tools are CSS (Sass), vanilla JavaScript, Eleventy, Lerna, Fractal, npm and writing lots of documentation.

I seek out challenges of efficiency and communication.

{# I've found this challenge a recurrent and beneficial problem to solve in newspaper reporting, e-commerce, corporate websites and often in things as simple as a rather messy brochure. Below I've attempted to show how my various work experience (left) equates to major areas of my knowledge (right), and I've added a few key lenses in the middle. #}

  <div class="vf-content">

EMBL is Europe‚Äôs flagship laboratory for the life sciences and employees hundreds of developers to deliver online scientific services. We've created reusable front end tooling to speed development, reduce cost and improve UX. It's been especially interesting for the breadth of technology and wide the range of user needs and developer backgrounds. 

I lead the creation of this tooling, the Visual Framework, and serve as its lead advocate to help developers and product designers to utilise and implement. I also ensure the Visual Framework adapts to those needs. This is an expansion of my role for the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).

- Grow, evolve projects from EMBL-EBI into pan-EMBL solutions 
- Information architecture and component tooling for EMBL web content, design systems
- Architect abstracted web content platform, navigation
- Facilitate collaboration between UX, developers and content teams
- Foster design system growth, adoption by coordinating with development leads
